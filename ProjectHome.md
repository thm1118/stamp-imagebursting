<h2>What is it?</h2>
Application used to burst a scanned image of stamps into a series of sub-images. The application supports the following features:
<br>
<ul><li>Save images as JPEG or PNG formats<br>
</li><li>Specify an output DPI different than the image loaded<br>
</li><li>Burst the images to subfolders based on a set of criteria (country names for example)<br>
</li><li>Supports auto-generation of a filename<br>
</li><li>Rotation (90 degree segments) of burst images<br>
</li><li>Processes light and dark background images<br>
</li><li>Uses advanced particle analysis image processing for stamp detection.</li></ul>
